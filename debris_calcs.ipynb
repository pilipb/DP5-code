    "# Calculating the worst case debris\n",
    "The calculation will follow this logic:\n",
    "1. For a chosen material with impact toughness `I` and thickness `t` there is a maximum energy of impact before the component fails.\n",
    "The worst case object dimensions can be calculated as follows:\n",
    "2. The worst case velocity will be given as `u` and found as a flood velocity.\n",
    "3. The worst case mass can then be calculated from the KE equation.\n",
    "4. For floating debris with mass `m` the smallest possible size will occur at a maximum floating density limit of `rho = 1000kg/m^3`\n",
    "5. Assuming that debris that is a long prism is unlikely to enter through the deflectors at the correct angle, a cube shape is used to calculate the worst case width/height/length which will be used to define the spacing of the protective grating on the device."
